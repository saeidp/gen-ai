You may encounter build error and the fix is as follows
CodeBuild was failing during uv pip install . because setuptools couldn’t auto-discover the package in the flat layout: it saw multiple top-level modules and aborted with “Multiple top-level modules discovered”. Adding [tool.setuptools] py-modules = ["strands_claude_context"] in pyproject.toml explicitly told it what to include, so the build succeeded and the agent deployed.
