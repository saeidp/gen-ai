Dear John,

I regret to inform you that 
I, Tom, will not be able to attend the 10 am meeting at Canary Wharf today. However, I can make it at 12 pm in New York. I have a conflict that has come up and I am unable to make the 10 am time.

Please let the rest of the team know, and we can follow up after the meeting to get me up to speed on anything important.

Thank you for your understanding.

Sincerely,
Tom
