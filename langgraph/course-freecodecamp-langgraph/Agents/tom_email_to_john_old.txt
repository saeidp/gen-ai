Dear John,

I regret to inform you that I will not be able to attend the meeting today at 10 am at Canary Wharf. However, I am available to meet with you at 12 pm the next day in New York. 

Please accept my apologies for the short notice. I will be sure to follow up with you after the meeting to get any updates or action items.

Thank you for your understanding.

Sincerely,
Tom
