    "# Task 4: Conversational Interface - Chat with Llama 3 and Titan Premier LLMs\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, you build a chatbot using the llama3-8b-instruct and titan-text-premier Foundation Models (FMs) in Amazon Bedrock.\n",
    "\n",
    "Conversational interfaces such as chatbots and virtual assistants can enhance the user experience for your customers. Chatbots use natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning algorithms to understand and respond to user queries. You can use chatbots in a variety of applications, such as customer service, sales, and e-commerce, to provide quick and efficient responses to users. Users can access them through various channels such as websites, social media platforms, and messaging apps.\n",

    "## LangChain framework for building Chatbot with Amazon Bedrock\n",
    "\n",
    "In conversational interfaces such as chatbots, remembering previous interactions becomes highly important, both at a short-term and long-term level.\n",
    "\n",
    "The LangChain framework provides memory components in two forms. First, LangChain provides helper utilities for managing and manipulating previous chat messages. These are designed to be modular. Secondly, LangChain provides easy ways to incorporate these utilities into chains, allowing you to easily define and interact with different types of abstractions, which make powerful chatbots easy for you to build.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Building a Chatbot with Context - Key Elements\n",
    "\n",
    "The first process in building a context-aware chatbot is to generate embeddings for the context. Typically, you have an ingestion process which runs through your embedding model and generates the embeddings, which will then be stored in a vector store. In this notebook, you use the Titan Embeddings model for this. The second process is user request orchestration, interaction, invoking, and returning the results. This involves orchestrating the user request, interacting with the necessary models/components to gather information, invoking the chatbot to formulate a response, and then returning the chatbot's response back to the user."
