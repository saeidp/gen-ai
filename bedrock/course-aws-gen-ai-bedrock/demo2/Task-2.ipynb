This new standard requires lessees to recognize a lease liability and a right-of-use (ROU) asset for all leases, with the exception of short-term leases. The new standard also requires lessees to classify leases as either finance or operating leases, with finance leases being those that transfer substantially all of the risks and rewards of ownership to the lessee.      As a result of adopting ASC 842, AnyCompany has recorded a ROU asset of $100 million and a lease liability of $100 million as of January 1, 2022.\n",

Financing leases are leases in which the underlying asset is used in the normal course of business, but the lease payments are structured in a way that provides AnyCompany with the option to purchase the underlying asset at the end of the lease term. At the end of the lease term, AnyCompany has the right to purchase the underlying asset for a nominal amount. As of December 31, 2021, AnyCompany has entered into financing leases with a total lease liability of $30 million and a weighted-average remaining lease term of 7 years.      Sales-type leases are leases in which AnyCompany is the lessor and the underlying asset is sold to the lessee at the beginning of the lease term. The lease payments are structured in a way that provides AnyCompany with a profit or loss on the sale of the underlying asset.
